## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Input mortgage information and see monthly repayment and total repayment amounts after submitting the form
- See form validation messages if any field is incomplete
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JS with syntax for types.
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework

### What I learned

I learned how to use really well the useReducer hook so that I can easily manage the state in case of form.

### Continued development

I still want to use the useReducer hook to manage complex state specially for form.

### Useful resources

- [How to use the compound component design pattern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26ogBZXeBwc) - This helped me for using the useReducer hook.
